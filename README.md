📌 Project Description

This project implements and compares three CPU scheduling techniques — FCFS, Round Robin, and an optimized Hill Climbing–based scheduler — using Java.
It evaluates each algorithm based on average waiting time, enabling performance analysis for different scheduling strategies.
The simulator takes a set of processes with arrival and burst times, runs them through the three algorithms, and prints comparative results for easy benchmarking.
