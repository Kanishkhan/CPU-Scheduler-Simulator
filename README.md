# CPU Scheduler Simulator 🚀

A powerful and interactive web-based **CPU Scheduling Simulator** designed to visualize and compare different process scheduling algorithms. Ideally built for students and developers to understand the core concepts of operating system scheduling.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Add processes dynamically with Arrival Time and Burst Time.
- **Multiple Algorithms**:
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: The simplest scheduling algorithm.
  - **Round Robin (RR)**: Processes are dispatched in a FIFO manner but are given a limited amount of CPU time (Quantum = 5).
  - **Hill Climbing Optimization**: A heuristic approach to find an optimized schedule sequence for better average waiting time.
- **Visual Results**: View the process table and compare Average Waiting Times across algorithms in a clear, tabular format.
- **Modern UI**: Built with a sleek **Glassmorphism** design using CSS3.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: for styling, animations, and the glassmorphism effect.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For implementation of scheduling logic and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kanishkhan/CPU-Scheduler-Simulator.git
    ```
2.  **Open the project**:
    Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Add Processes**:
    - Enter the **Arrival Time** and **Burst Time** in the input fields.
    - Click **"Add Process"**.
2.  **Run Simulation**:
    - Once you have added all desired processes, click **"Run Scheduling"**.
3.  **Analyze Results**:
    - The breakdown of average waiting times for FCFS, Round Robin, and Hill Climbing will be displayed in the **Results** section.
